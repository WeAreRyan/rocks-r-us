## Introduction
<br>
Welcome to Rocks-R-Us, a place for all your rocky needs. This web application has been created as display of ability to create a simple marketplace using the react library/framework. Using multiple pages and components the user may browse the list of rocks for sale, add them to their cart and "checkout"(none-functional). The user can also view their order history and edit their cart in multiple ways.  

## Unsolved Problems
</br>
In that applications current state there are some issues regarding element sizing depending on the browser used and screen size. Additionally the user's cart does not rerender when checking out properly, currently the application navigates you to the order history page and hides the cart when checking out preventing this issue from being seen. 
There are also a handful of pages that have the bottom cut off for some reason.

## Next Steps
<br>
In the future I will be adding a checkout page with a none-functional payment system. I will also be re-making the home page of the app as I am not please with it's current state. I would also like to add search functionality to the items list.
